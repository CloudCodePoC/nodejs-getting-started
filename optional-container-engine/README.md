This optional tutorial will walk you through how to deploy the Bookshelf sample application to [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/). This tutorial is also applicable to [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) outside of Container Engine, but may require additional steps for external load balancing.

Please refer to the [Tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/tutorials/bookshelf-on-container-engine) for instructions on how to deploy this sample.
